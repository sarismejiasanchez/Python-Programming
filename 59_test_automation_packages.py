# TEST AUTOMATION PACKAGES

# In programming, the tests chosen for automation are the ones that have:
# 1. High repeatability and volume
# 2. Predictable environments and data
# 3. Determinants outcomes.

# There are a number of testing types that can be automated. 
# These include units, regression, and integration.
# An ideal test code must form a bridge between the programming codes and the test cases.

# The ideal steps involved in test automation are usually:
# 1. Preparing the test environment
# 2. Running the test scripts
# 3. Analyzing the results.

# Let's now examine some important Python testing frameworks that have grown in popularity over the years.
# First, let's explore the built-in testing package per unit or unittest.

# The unittest framework supports test automation, independent testing modules, and aggregation of tests into collections. 

# 1. Pytest and native Python library that is simple, easy to use, and reasonably scalable. 
#    It can handle several functional test types such as unit, integration, and end-to-end. 
#    There is support for parameterized testing which enables us to execute unit tests multiple times 
#    with different parameters passed. 
#    It can run parallel tests and generates HTML, XML, or plain texts reports. 
#    You can also integrate it with other frameworks like PyUnit and Nose2, and web frameworks like Flask and Django.
#    While primarily used with testing APIs, it's also well used with UI, database connections, and other web applications. 
#    Easy creation and quick bug fixes a why Pytest is the most popular testing framework for automation. 
# 
# 2. Robot, which is popular primarily for its keyword-driven development capabilities. 
#    These keywords are used in test cases and can be predefined or user-defined. 
#    Robot is very versatile and use for:
#    - Acceptance testing
#    - Robotic Process Automation (RPA)
#    - Test-Driven Development (TDD). 
#    It can be used for many domains, including:
#    - Android
#    - APIs
#    - Mainframes. 
# 
# 3. Selenium, is another open-source testing framework that has gained popularity over time, 
#    and it's primarily driven towards a web applications. 
#    It has support for the majority of web browsers and OS. 
#    There a browser-specific web drivers that enable testing functionalities like 
#    login, button clicks, and filling out forms.
#    It allows the test set to select the speed and execution of tests and 
#    it has an option to run specific tests or tests suites. 

# Apart from the popular frameworks Pytest, Robot, and Selenium, there are many more. 
# It's important to know that a number of these testing frameworks 
# are often used with other tools such as plug-ins, widgets, extensions, test runners, and drivers. 
# These tools help integrate the software pieces being tested and add functionality. 
# Sometimes more than one framework has employed over the code being tested. 
# 
# Automation testing is an important reason why the software industry is able to move ahead swiftly and more smoothly. 
# Manual testing provides focused attention and the ability to handle nuances and complex problems with more sophistication. 
# This kind of testing can't be replaced by automated tests yet. 
# It still sometime before test scenarios can be fully automated, 
# but the development of all these frameworks are in line with that endeavor.
