# TEST DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT (TDD)

# Test-driven development, or TDD, is an alternative programming practice in which 
# the tests are written first and the code is written so that the tests will pass.


# Test Driven Development (TDD) is a software development process that relies on the repetition of a very short development cycle:
# 1. Write a test for a feature that fails.
# 2. Write code in accordance with the tests.
# 3. Run the tests expecting them to fail.
# 4. Evaluate the error and refactor the code as needed.
# 5. Rerun the process.

# This process is also called the red green refactor cycle. 
# - Red implies the failed tests
# - Green shows the passing tests after refactoring. 
# 
# The whole point of following this cycle is to fail the tests and rewrite until you don't have to. 
# A feature is complete when everything is green and you no longer need to rerun. 
# 
# You can use a package libraries such as PyTest when automation becomes a priority. 
# Pytest only requires writing functions while a unit test requires classes. 
# This means that pytest has the advantage of being easier because it requires less effort. 
# 
# Advantages of TDD
# 1. Writing tests first and refactoring code based on it, ensures the test cover the code. 
#    You can now write tests with a specific feature and outcome in mind. 
# 2. The need for such forecasting provides clarity from the beginning. 
# 3. The forecasting also plays a role in integrating different components 
#    where you add new features and interface is in accordance with the components that are already there. 
# 4. Working in cycles over the code, it gives us develop a competence that easily refactor in terms of additional changes.

# Overall, smaller code with early bug fixes, code extensibility and eventual ease of debugging 
# of the primary reasons TDD is growing and acceptance. 

# Differences between TDD and traditional testing. 
# The main difference is that with TDD, the requirements and standards 
# are highlighted from the beginning, making it purposeful. 
# 
# Modern-day development often employs a combination of both these forms of testing, 
# depending on the different parts and stages of the software development cycle. 

# There are several subtypes and variations of test-driven development. These include: 
# 1. Behavior-driven
# 2. Acceptance test-driven
# 3. Scaling and develop a test-driven development. 
# These are all options that can be used in the software development process.
