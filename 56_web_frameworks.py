# WEB FRAMEWORKS

"""
This module provides an overview of web frameworks, focusing on those available in Python and their classification.

Web frameworks are software tools designed to provide a standardized way of building, deploying, and supporting 
web applications. They automate repetitive tasks, enabling developers to concentrate on application logic, which 
significantly reduces development time. Web frameworks also offer structured and default models that make web 
applications more stable, maintainable, and scalable.

These frameworks are typically written in high-level code, abstracting complex operations such as socket 
communication, threading, and protocol handling. As a result, developers can focus more on business logic 
instead of low-level implementation details.

Python is widely used in web development due to its:
- Excellent documentation and community support
- Rich ecosystem of libraries and packages
- Ease of implementation and integration
- Secure and reusable codebase

Python web frameworks handle common web tasks such as:
- Form processing
- HTTP request routing
- Database connectivity
- User authentication
- Debugging and testing (profiling, test automation, and coverage)

### Types of Python Web Frameworks:

1. **Full-stack Frameworks**:
    - Comprehensive tools for large-scale applications
    - Features include templating, form validation, HTTP handling, and database integration
    - Popular examples: `Django`, `Web2py`, `Pyramid`

2. **Microframeworks**:
    - Lightweight frameworks suitable for smaller apps and APIs
    - Do not include built-in tools like ORM or validation by default
    - Popular examples: `Flask`, `Bottle`, `Dash`, `CherryPy`

3. **Asynchronous Frameworks**:
    - Designed to manage many concurrent connections using `asyncio`
    - Suitable for real-time applications
    - Popular examples: `AIOHTTP`, `Sanic`, `Growler`

### Key Frameworks:

- **Django**: A high-level full-stack framework that supports rapid development and clean design. It includes 
    built-in authentication, templating, ORM, and more. Itâ€™s known for its security, scalability, and extensive 
    third-party support.

- **Flask**: A microframework best suited for small-scale projects or APIs. It is lightweight, easy to learn, 
    and highly extensible through third-party extensions.

Framework selection depends on factors like scalability, flexibility, documentation, and specific project requirements.
