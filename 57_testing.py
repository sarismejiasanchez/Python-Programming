# WHAT IS TESTING?
# Testing is the process of evaluating a system or its components to determine whether they satisfy specified requirements.

# There are a few good practices that must be followed in testing to achieve optimal results. 
# 1. Test code allowing reusability of tests. 
# 2. Tests must be traceable to the requirements set. 
# 3. Tests written must be purpose-driven, efficient, and allow for repeatability. 
# These testing techniques can then follow a procedural approach according to the type of testing used. 

# The testing lifecycle in general can be broadly described as:
# 1. Planning
# 2. Preparation
# 3. Execution
# 4. Reporting

# The steps involved in achieving this can includE:
# 1. Writing Scripts and test cases.
# 2. Compiling test results.
# 3. Correcting defects based on them.
# 4. Generating reports from our test results.

# They are a general sets of actions containing steps, data, pre and post-conditions written for a specific purpose.
# This purpose can improve:
# 1. Functionality
# 2. Flow
# 3. Finding defects. 

# A well-written test case eventually provides:
# 1. Good coverage
# 2. Reusability
# 3. Better user experience
# 4. Reduces costs
# 5. Increases overall satisfaction.

# There are also many testing types using practice. These include:
# 1. Compatibility
# 2. Ad hoc
# 3. Usability
# 4. Regression testing. 

# For now, I just want you to know that with testing, there is no one-size-fits-all solution. 
#  When testing products, it's also important to understand when to stop. 
# There is no application will ever be 100 percent perfect. 
# Otherwise, a developer may feel the product is well-tested, but realize it's full of bugs 
# and flaws as soon as it's released to the end-users. 

# A few metrics can be established for this purpose, given that there are well-written test cases in place. These include:
# 1. A certain number of tests cycles
# 2. Passing percentage of test cases
# 3. Time deadlines
# 4. Time intervals between subsequent test failures. 

# Testing in software development can be seen as the anchor of a ship or insurance for your vehicle. 
# You can hope that everything operates smoothly, but often it does not and while you can aim for perfection, 
# there is always potential for human error.
